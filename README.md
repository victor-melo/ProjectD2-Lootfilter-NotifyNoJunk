# Notify (No Junk) Loot Filter
This loot filter highlights a few items and minimally filters out drops that no one would ever use. I created this filter with the intention to fill a few gaps with the default highlighting rules while still leaving the default experiance mostly unchanged.

This filter has been tested with Season 2, newer seasons may or may not work.

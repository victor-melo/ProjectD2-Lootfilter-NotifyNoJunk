# Notify (No Junk) Loot Filter
This loot filter highlights a few items and minimally filters out drops that no one would ever use. I created this filter with the intention to fill a few gaps with the default highlighting rules while still leaving the default experiance mostly unchanged.

This filter has been tested with Season 2, newer seasons may or may not work.

# Changes

## Enchanced ground display
* Show Ethereal & Socketed Items on ground

## New Highlights
* Flawless & Perfect Gems on ground (Red).
* Full Rejuvenation Potion on ground (Purple).
* Charms & Jewels (Dark Green).
* Runes with their rune number (Orange). Similar to the stock configuration but also notify on AMN rune or above.

## Hide Junk
* Hide Arrows & Bolts after reaching Level 15.
* Hide Chipped & Flawed gems after reaching level 50.
* Hide Inferior items (Damaged, Cracked, etc..) except for class specific items (Druid Pelts, Sorc Wands, etc..).
* Hide Throwing Potions (Fulminating Potion, Exploding Potion, Oil Potion, Strangling Potion, Choking Potion, Rancid Potion).

## Notifications and map icon on the following item drops:
* All Unique
* All Set
* Charms
* Jewels
* Rare class specific items (Sorceress Wands, Druid Pelts, etc.)
* Rare Gloves, Boots, Belths
* Runedrops AMN or higher
